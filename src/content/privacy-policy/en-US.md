## Introduction

This is a simple URL shortening service. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected when you use this service.

## Information Collection

**This service itself only collects:**

- The original URL you want to shorten
- Your chosen custom short link (if applicable)

That's it. We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, or browsing history. We do not require you to create an account.

## Cloudflare Information

Cloudflare may collect additional information such as IP addresses and browser information. This is not controlled by the URL shortening service itself.

For details about Cloudflare's data practices, please see [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

## How We Use Information

The collected URLs are only used to:

- Create and maintain the short link
- Redirect users from the short link to the original URL

We do not use your information for marketing, do not sell your data, and do not track your online behavior.

## Cookies

This service itself does not use cookies for tracking. Cloudflare may use cookies as part of its service.

## Links to Other Websites

When you use a shortened link, you will be redirected to another website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any third-party sites.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the administrator of the specific deployment you are using. For the reference implementation, you can use the GitHub repository.
